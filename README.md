Home-brewing every machine learning solution is not only time-consuming but potentially error-prone (as you may have discovered). One of the reasons we're using Python in this course is because it has some very powerful machine learning tools. Besides common scientific computing packages such as SciPy and NumPy, It's very helpful in practice to use frameworks such as Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Pytorch, and MXNet to support your projects, as their utilities have been developed by a team of professionals and undergo rigorous testing and verification.  In this project I explored the Pytorch framework.
